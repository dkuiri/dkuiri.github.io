# Research

My research focuses on understanding **quantum transport phenomena** and **topological superconductivity** in nanoscale and low-dimensional systems.

I am particularly interested in how geometry, material properties, and superconducting phases influence the electronic transport and emergent topological states in **hybrid superconducting systems**.

## 🧠 Research Overview

My work explores how superconductivity and topology intertwine to give rise to novel quasiparticle excitations, such as **Majorana bound states**, in nanoscopic and hybrid Josephson junctions.  

I use **theoretical modeling** and **numerical simulations** to study non-local transport signatures, Andreev bound states, and phase-controlled topological transitions in these systems.
