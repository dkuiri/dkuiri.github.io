# Research

My research focuses on understanding **quantum transport phenomena** and **topological superconductivity** in nanoscale and low-dimensional systems.

I am particularly interested in how geometry, material properties, and superconducting phases influence the electronic transport and emergent topological states in **hybrid superconducting systems**.
