# Academic & research experience

## PhD research (2021–2025)
**[Department of Theory of Quantum Systems](https://acmin.agh.edu.pl/en/research/department-of-theory-of-quantum-systems)**  
**[Academic Centre for Materials and Nanotechnology (ACMiN)](https://acmin.agh.edu.pl/),  
[AGH University of Krakow](https://www.agh.edu.pl/en/), Poland**

Supervisor: **[Dr. hab. inż. Michał P. Nowak](http://mpnowak.org/)**

**Dissertation:**  
*Electronic Transport and Topological Superconductivity in Nanoscopic Josephson Junctions*  
**Status:** Submitted

**Research overview:**  
My PhD research focuses on quantum transport in nanoscopic and planar Josephson junctions, addressing the physics of **Andreev bound states**, **Majorana bound states**, and transport signatures of **topological superconductivity**. Andreev bound-state spectra in perpendicular magnetic fields are analyzed, demonstrating how the **magnetic vector potential** induces relative phase shifts that provide a transparent explanation of experimental tunneling spectra, such as those observed by the [Goswami Lab at Qutech, TU Delft](https://qutech.nl/lab/goswami-lab/). The interplay between **spin–orbit coupling** and magnetic field is shown to enable **nonlocal conductance** as a reliable probe of topological superconductivity. Realistic device limitations, including phase slips in junctions embedded in superconducting loops, are found to hinder the emergence of Majorana bound states at low magnetic fields. To overcome these constraints, elongated Josephson junction geometries are proposed, widening the accessible phase interval and reducing the magnetic field required for topological transitions. The work further examines how **spin–orbit coupling** and **Zeeman interaction** modify subgap conductance features arising from **multiple Andreev reflections** in voltage-biased Josephson junctions, providing guidance for experimental implementations of topological devices.

## Junior research fellow (DST–SERB) — 2018–2021
**Department of Physics,  
Savitribai Phule Pune University (University of Pune), India**

Supervisors:  
**[Prof. Bishwajyoti Dey](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=6Su9JiAAAAAJ)**,  
**[Dr. Mithun Thudiyangal](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=p1FL4ccAAAAJ&hl=en)**

**Research overview:**  
This research investigated vortex pinning and structural transitions of vortex lattices in rotating two-component Bose–Einstein condensates. Numerical simulations based on the time-dependent coupled Gross–Pitaevskii equations were employed to study the effects of disorder, periodic pinning potentials, and intercomponent interactions. The results demonstrate that even a single impurity can induce transitions between triangular and square vortex-lattice configurations. In the presence of optical lattices, pinned vortex structures emerge, while random disorder leads to vortex-lattice melting via a two-step process involving the formation of defects, dislocations, and disclinations. These findings provide insight into vortex matter and collective phenomena in multicomponent quantum fluids.

## M.Sc. Research Project (2017–2018)
**National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Pune, India**

Supervisor: **[Dr. Kavita Joshi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IzJrY6UAAAAJ&hl=en)**

**Research overview:**  
The M.Sc. project involved first-principles electronic-structure calculations based on **density functional theory (DFT)** to investigate surface reactions. Slab models of Ag surfaces were constructed using a 2×2 supercell with multiple atomic layers and variable vacuum spacing along the surface-normal direction. Total-energy calculations were performed to study adsorption and reaction energetics of molecules such as CO₂, O₂, and CH₄. This work provided hands-on experience in DFT-based surface-science modeling and computational materials physics.
