i# About Me

Hi, I’m **Dibyendu Kuiri** from Purulia, West Bengal, India.

I have submitted my Ph.D. thesis titled  
**"Electronic Transport and Topological Superconductivity in Nanoscopic Josephson Junctions"**  
under the supervision of **Dr. Michal P. Nowak** (http://mpnowak.org)  
at the **Department of Theory of Quantum Systems, Academic Centre for Materials and Nanotechnology (ACMiN), AGH University of Krakow**.

My work focuses on understanding **quantum behavior in low-dimensional and hybrid superconducting systems**,  
with particular interest in **topological superconductivity** and emergent phenomena in **Josephson junctions**.
